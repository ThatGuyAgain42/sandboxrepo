you make a new file and name it:
"Whatever you want" with a slash (this one -> / not the other one \) at the end

uhhhhh i dont know if you can move files from dirs but if you can its not intuitive :/

test of adding an image to readme:

things i want to figure out:

> ~~how to add specific files to releases (exe, apk, ect)~~ those are the "binaries" you can attach

> ~~how to get a link to file contents.
sometimes i see css or html that import from github sources that bring you to a page of just the raw source text~~ maybe the big "RAW" button

> ~~hyperlinks in readme files? is it possible? [maybe its like reddit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThatGuyAgain42/sandboxrepo/main/figured%20out%20how%20to%20make%20folders/cooltext391689395848516.png)~~ yep. its just like reddit
